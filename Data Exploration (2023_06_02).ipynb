      "    \"main_text\": \"Amid the spread of the novel coronavirus, many people are wondering how likely they are to get it. Often, their second question is: If I get coronavirus, how likely am I to survive it? One chart, created by the website Information is Beautiful, says that 80% of coronavirus cases are \\\"mild.\\\" So is that true? The chart is a tad misleading. It makes a blanket statement about the virus while basing its claim on a study by China\\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and a website called Statistica. The post doesn\\u2019t include links to the reports. An important note: The percentage of mild cases shouldn\\u2019t be confused with your likelihood of surviving a stint of the virus, also known as COVID-19. Mortality rates differ depending on a person\\u2019s age and health. The virus is relatively new. So there\\u2019s a lot researchers have yet to nail down. That said, the post is mostly consistent with available data. In February, CNN reported on the release of the study conducted by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology. The study itself said that in confirmed coronavirus cases, 70% were \\\"normal,\\\" 25.5% were \\\"severe\\\" and 4.5% were \\\"light.\\\" But Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of World Health Organization, said during a press conference on Feb. 17 that more than 80% of patients \\\"have mild disease and will recover.\\\" Meanwhile, 13.8% of cases suffer severe symptoms and 6.1% are critical. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\u2019s website on March 13 said a \\\"complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully known.\\\" However, the CDC said \\\"most cases\\\" are mild, citing a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. That study looked at medical records for coronavirus patients documented by the National Health Commission between Dec. 11 and Jan. 29. \\\"On admission, the degree of severity of COVID-19 was categorized as nonsevere in 926 patients and severe in 173 patients,\\\" the study reads. That means 84 percent were considered non-severe. Age and baseline health were factors in whether a patient\\u2019s illness became severe, the study said. \\\"Patients with severe disease were older than those with nonsevere disease by a median of seven years. Moreover, the presence of any coexisting illness was more common among patients with severe disease than among those with nonsevere disease,\\\" it said. The chart says 80.9% of cases are mild. It\\u2019s important to note that different age groups have had different levels of severity. However, generally speaking, the chart is on track. We found that mild cases account for roughly 75-to-80% of cases, according to studies published by the WHO and CDC. The statement is mostly accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\",\n",

       " 'main_text': 'After the solar eclipse that crossed the United States on 21 August 2017, several national and international news organizations reported that people had applied sunscreen to their eyes in the mistaken hope of avoiding damage during the eclipse. For example,\\xa0Fox News reported “Health professionals report cases where people put sunscreen on their eyeballs to watch eclipse.” Forbes magazine wrote “For the eclipse, people put sunscreen on their eyeballs” and in the UK, the Independent wrote “Eclipse 2017: People treated for putting sun tan lotion on eyeballs to watch solar event”. All of these stories depend on one thing: the unverified account of a single person in one location who related what a colleague had purportedly told her. On 22 August 2017, the day after the eclipse, the Redding, California television news channel KRCR published a report which quoted a local nurse practitioner: According to Redding Nurse Practitioner Trish Patterson, some people have reported pain after they put sunscreen in their eye’s Monday because they did not have protective glasses to watch the eclipse. “One of my colleagues at moonlight here stated yesterday that they had patients presenting at their clinic that put sunscreen on their eyeball, and presented that they were having pain and they were referred to an ophthalmologist,” Patterson said. We attempted to contact Patterson on more than one occasion but were unable to track her down, so we were unable to ask her for evidence that might support or corroborate her claim or to speak to the colleague who purportedly told her about the patients. Therefore, we cannot say whether anyone in the Redding, California area did in fact apply sunscreen to their eyes in advance of the solar eclipse in August 2017. It is certainly possible, but it is also possible that a miscommunication (including the possibility of a misunderstood joke or undetected irony) happened at several stages: between Patterson and the KRCR reporter; between Patterson and her colleague; and between her colleague and someone else, if the colleague was not present when the patients purportedly presented themselves. We contacted an ophthalmologist and three urgent care clinics in Redding, California (other than Patterson’s own), and none of them reported seeing any patients with any eye damage related to the solar eclipse. We also tried to find other instances of people putting sunscreen on their eyeballs \\xa0by selecting 13 cities across the United States where the eclipse coverage was similar to that in Redding (around 86 percent of the sun was covered), and calling urgent care clinics and ophthalmologists. None reported seeing any patients who had applied sunscreen to their eyes. In fact, only one said they had seen “a few” patients with any sort of eye damage from the eclipse.',\n",
